# Guestbook

A guestbook I had to write during a school assignment. It's a python script that uses a sqlite3 database to save down names and messages.


# Setup

Step 1. 

Download the script ```git clone https://github.com/Ejo2001/Guestbook.git```

Step 2.

Install Python ```sudo apt install python3.9```  

Step 3. 

Run it ```python3 /path/to/script```
